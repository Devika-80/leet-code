Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.


solution:
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        
        int length = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                length++;
            }
            else if (length > 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return length;
    }
}

explanation:
Example 1: "Hello World"
Trim String → "Hello World"
Loop Backward:

Copy
Edit
'd' -> length = 1
'l' -> length = 2
'r' -> length = 3
'o' -> length = 4
'W' -> length = 5
' ' (space encountered) -> break
