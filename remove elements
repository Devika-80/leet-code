Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100



solution:

class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}




Execution Steps:
Initial Array: nums = {3, 2, 2, 3}

Value to remove: val = 3
Initialization:

index = 0: Tracks the position where the next valid element will be placed.
Iterate through the array:

Step 1 (i = 0):

Check if nums[0] != val → 3 != 3 is false.
Skip this element.
index remains 0.
Step 2 (i = 1):

Check if nums[1] != val → 2 != 3 is true.
Place nums[1] at nums[0] → nums = {2, 2, 2, 3}.
Increment index to 1.
Step 3 (i = 2):

Check if nums[2] != val → 2 != 3 is true.
Place nums[2] at nums[1] → nums = {2, 2, 2, 3} (no visible change here).
Increment index to 2.
Step 4 (i = 3):

Check if nums[3] != val → 3 != 3 is false.
Skip this element.
index remains 2.
End of Loop:

The loop finishes, and index = 2.
The first index elements of nums are the elements that are not equal to val.
Return:

The function returns index = 2.
Final Result:
New Length: 2
Modified Array: The first 2 elements are {2, 2}, and the rest can be ignored.
